VisualJSON is very simple JSON pretty-viewer for Mac OS X.

# How it works
1. You can read JSON with Tree view or pretty Text format.
2. Suggest json text to 'Content' field. Copy & Paste your JSON or input local/remote address.
3. For http/https, VisualJSON requests 'application/json'.
4. For http/https, POST data field is available, if you need.

# For developers
